# 20-Newsgroup-Topic-Categorization
Categorization of 20 Newsgroup (Reddit-like opinion threads) entries by:

(1) pre-processing the entries by eliminating conjunctions, prepositions, and symbols 
(2) extracting each entry's tf - idf features using open-source sklearn library
(3) applying Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Decision Trees classification algorithms from open-source 
sklearn libraries to classify each entry to a correct topic
(4) comparing the performace of each algorithm 

This is done for a project while taking a [machine learning course](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jlucas/teaching/csc411/) at University of Toronto.
